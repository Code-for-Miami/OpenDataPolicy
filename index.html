<h2><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/capabilities/open-data/#intro">What is Open Data?</a></h2>
  <div>
  <p>Open data refers to data (such as documents, databases, records, or transcripts, including those managed by outside vendors) released by a government or organization that is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>freely available</strong> to be used, shared, and reused by anyone for any purpose, commercial or otherwise.</li>
    <li><strong>available in digital, machine-readable formats</strong> (such as .csv) so that it can be used in combination with other data and applications.</li>
    <li><strong>available in its entirety</strong> — and able to be downloaded “in bulk” and not just manually retrieved record-by-record.</li>
  </ul>
